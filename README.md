# PyORT
PyORT (Python Obscenity Ranking Tool) is a program that ranks text inputs or files based on obscenity. Simply specific your input and receive a ranking.

***DISCLAIMER***: The words and phrases used were gathered via a sweep and do not represent the creators of the program.

##How it works
Obscenity rankings are based on three distinct criteria, slogans, obscene words, and amplifiers.

##Future functionality
Sweeping datasets to learn new obscene words, slogans, and amplifiers

Using similar words, which involves filtering out the similar words that aren't connected to an obscene word.

Using stemming rather than full comparing.

More accurate ranking.
